								<strong>Description:</strong> First person action where the aim is to survive as long as
								possible against the hordes of minions. Compete for the highest kill count.
								<br><br>
								<strong>Core Mechanics:</strong>
								<li><b>Bullet Time</b> - By stepping the time dilation up and down the player is able to
									enter a slow motion state. This is bound to a timer that depletes when slow motion
									is active and gradually regenerates when not in use.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Explosions!</b> - When a grenade is thrown, a timer begins that calls it's
									delegate function to handle the explosion. At detonation, all enemies within a
									defined spherical radius are added to an array. This array is iterrated over to deal
									damage to, and add a physics force in the direction of the enemy. Custom physics
									rigs
									were created to simulate ragdoll effects.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Dual-wielding</b> - Operate both pistols independently. Enumerators were declared
									to assign each weapon to a constant. A set of common functions were defined for
									firing and reloading that accepted these enumerators as parameters, allowing for
									seperate functionality.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>External Ballistics</b> - Projectiles are instantiated in the game world and act
									as physics objects, travelling in a parabolic curve towards their intended target.
									Collision events were programmed to handle damage, visuals and contextual sound
									spawning. Custom
									visual effects were added to produce bullet trails, imitating real life "swirl".

								<strong>Description:</strong> A cyberpunk/sci-fi themed shooter. An exploration of third
								person combat
								mechanics in Unreal Engine.
								<br><br>
								<strong>Core Mechanics:</strong>
								<li><b>World Interaction</b> - Through the use of raycasting, any object within a
									certain range of the player's crosshair can be targetted. If the returned hit result
									is a physics object, the player is able to interact with the attached physics handle
									and move the object within the scene.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>AI Behaviour</b> - Behaviour trees were built to enable enemy searching,
									patrolling and attacking routines. Services, tasks, decorators and selectors were
									scripted in C++ to give the AI contoller access to certain player variables
									such as their location.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Ranged Combat</b> - Custom line tracing was employed to determine what players
									can shoot through and what they have hit. If the object is an enemy character then a
									custom function is called in order to deal damage. Firing weapons also instantiates
									sound and visual effects.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Camera Effects</b> - The zoom effect when aiming was acheived by employing a
									timeline to return a float value at a given point along a curve. The camera then
									interpolates between two field of view values depending on the returned float.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>State Machines</b> - By integrating Epic's Paragon assets from the marketplace,
									animations and
									blendspaces were able to be triggered depending on the character's state. Custom
									events were used when syncing blended animations and managing combat behaviour.</li>

								<strong>Description:</strong> Magic Ike is a top down action game.
								Gameplay mechanics, particle effects and user interface were all built from the ground
								up and
								combined with models from the assest store.
								<br><br>
								<strong>Core Mechanics:</strong>
								<li><b>Magic Projectiles</b> - When the player attacks, a script decrements their mana
									and spawn a projectile. If an enemy collider is hit, it calls to their stats
									component to take damage. The projectile, impact and casting effects were all drawn
									in photoshop and created using Unity's VFX graph.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Character Stats</b> - This component manages the player and enemy stats, such as
									health and mana. When damage is received or a character is killed it co-ordinates
									the sending of necessary messages to handle the event.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Power-Ups</b> - On enemy death a random number generator will determine if a
									power-up is spawned, selecting randomly from an array of classes. Power-up behaviour
									and active effects are governed by two over-arching classes, employing the use of a
									dictionary to map collected power-ups to their remaining duration in seconds and
									remove them when it reches zero.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Design Patterns</b> - Software was designed with class hierarchy and
									Object-Oriented patterns in mind, such as the Factory Pattern and Singleton Pattern
									when deciding which power-ups to instantiate and providing a single global point of
									access to manage their active
									effects.</li>

								<strong>Description:</strong> An endless runner game. Dodge obstacles and rack up the
								best high score you can. The further you go, the higher your score.
								<br><br>
								<strong>Core Mechanics:</strong>
								<li><b>Procedural Generation</b> - Terrain tiles were designed with references to an
									array of transform variables and an array of obstacle classes. The construction
									script selects from these arrays, randomly spawning variations of obstacles as the
									terrain is
									instantiated.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Trigger Volumes</b> - Trigger
									volumes were used to despawn terrain tiles off camera, as the player overlaps them.
									As tiles are removed, new tiles are spawned at the front of the level.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Collision Detection</b> - Colliding with
									objects disables the player controller, initiates ragdoll physics and ends the run.
									A timer is triggered to reload the level.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>High Score Feature</b> - The game mode class handles score incrementation as the
									player progresses through the level. At certain thresholds the game logic will allow
									more obstacles to be spawned and speed to be increased, making the game harder.</li>

								<strong>Description:</strong> Pathfinding program that finds the shortest possible path
								between two points utilising the A* algorithm.
								<br><br>
								<strong>Core Mechanics:</strong>
								<li><b>Path Tree</b> - A hierarchical tree of known paths is stored along with their
									cost. These are incrementally extended until the end node is reached and the path
									with the least cost is chosen.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Priority Queue</b> - At each iteration, the node with the lowest path cost is
									removed from the open set and its neighbours are added, along with their updated
									costs.</li>
								<br>
								<li><b>Manhattan Distance</b> - The cost of each node is calculated by adding its path
									cost from the start node to it's estimated cheapest distance from the end node. The
									heuristic used to estimate this distance is Manhattan distance. </li>

					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					Royal Marines Commando turned software engineer.
					<br><br>
					During my time developing games I've worked on various titles across a large range of platforms, including an upcoming
					Star Wars game. Though I've been invlolved in many areas of the development process, including engine, tools and AI, my specialisation lies 
					in networking and gameplay. I've gained a thorough knowledge of the Gameplay Ability System and the various networking methods used in
					Unreal Engine, leveraging these capabilities to bring high quality games to a large audience.
					<br><br>
					Prior to that I spent nine years involved in military operations
					across the globe, including the defence of UK nuclear assets, providing humanitarian aid during the
					European migrant crisis and interdicting maritime drug smuggling vessels. I specialised as a
					Communication Systems Engineer in order to facilitate 3 Commando Brigade's satellite capabilities.
					<br><br>
					Alongside a first-class honors degree in computing from The Open University, my professional experience and military background has
					given me an excellent understanding of networking and programming concepts across a wide range of high tempo environments.
